# Grades Bot

I made this bot to check for your grades quickly without having to
go to the entire process manually.

It scraps your CUNEF grades, average grades and ranking position.
To install all the modules, run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

To use the bot, execute `py.exe .\grades_bot.py`. The first time you use it,
it will ask yoy for your email and password, but after that, your
credentials will be saved to avoid asking you every run

Chek your Chrome version. You can see if you need to update it by opening
Google, clicking on the three small dots on the upper right
corner > help > About Google Chrome. The crhomedriver included in this
folder runs version 91.0.4472.124.
